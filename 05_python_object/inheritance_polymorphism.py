# Inheritance
# We can inherit from the original class

class BaseClass:
    pass

class ChildClass(BaseClass):
    pass

# Example

class User:
  is_admin = False
  def __init__(self, username):
    self.username = username

class Admin(User):
  is_admin = True


# Defined User as base class. 
# Created the subclass Admin that inherit from User 
# Admin has the same constructor as User. 
# Only the class variable is_admin is set differently between the two.

# Exceptions
# issubclass() returns True if the first argument is a subclass of the second argument
# issubclass(object, classinfo)

issubclass(Admin, User) # True, Admin is a subclass of User
issubclass(User, Admin ) # False, User is not a subclass of Admin

# Super
# The super() builtin returns a proxy object that allows you to refer parent class by 'super'.
# It allows us to invoke a method of an object's parent class

# Class Dog print "Dog has four legs." and inherit method __init__ from Mammal that prints "is a warm-blooded animal."

# Example

# Polymorphism
# Polymorphism : same syntax doing different actions depending on the type of data.
